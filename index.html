        <p>
        <br>Roses are red 
        <br>Violets are blue
        <br>The little kid ate a glow stick
        <br>Now he's built like MewTwo
        <br>The boy's uses his phone
        <br>Then <strong>suddenly</strong> on his display nothing is shown
        <br>He reaches for the charger
        <br>The he unfortunately hit is funny <em>bone</em>
        <br>He's shouts with agony and <strong>pain</strong>
        <br>Then sleeps in his bed full of <em>shame</em>
